The server and client will be two different codes which will be run in different directories. For
example, let the server directory contain: file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt
The client will create a connection to the server and send requests to download files to the client
directory. It will write the files into its own directory.
Error handling such as requesting missing files must be handled.
